The beginnings of the modern computer date back to the 's when Blaise Pascal,
a French mathematician and scientist, developed one of the first mechanical calculating devices.
It is only within the past decade, however, 
that computer technology has become essential in the work environment. 
Almost every profession is deeply affected by the computer revolution: 
physicians consult computer-based expert systems to help diagnose illnesses; 
musicians compose and perform music using computers, and students 
and professionals in every field use electronic mail to communicate 
with both colleagues and strangers. With so many applications for computer 
technology, it is not surprising that the demand for computer professionals 
has been steadily rising.
